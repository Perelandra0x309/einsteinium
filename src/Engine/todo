Critical:
-Keep updated recent and ranked lists for immediate use by apps (instead of recalculating the list for every request)
-add version number to databases
-add MIME type to created databases
-new AppAttrFile looks for an existing database
-optimize for speed
-provide a -10 to 10 range for setting statistic weight in calculations (so at -10 more launches pushes app to lower rank, for example)

Soon:
-Enable a filtering system
-Automatically ignore background apps
-Function to create symlinks in given directory (accessable via sent BMessage).
-Add new attributes for recent apps, improve ranking system

Later:
-Catch opened documents
-Catch opened folders
-Catch opened URLs
-System uptime log
