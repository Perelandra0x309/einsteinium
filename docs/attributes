This file should be easiest to read in StyledEdit under BeOS R4.5 or higher. If the file gets extracted or moved to a non-BFS volume, the font sizes, wieghts and colors will be lost. 

Possible attribute list:

name
filename
rank
checksum
class: [ app_sig | mimetype ]
path: /boot/home/whatever
ignore: [ yes | no ]
owner: { app_sig1: [ position | ignore ] | app_sig2: [ position | ignore ] }
date_last_act
date_first_act
last_int
avg_daily_int
int_reg
daily_int_reg

Definitions:
name = the name of the application or document, if renamed by the user this will differ from filename and the interface should usually choose to display this instead of the actual filename

filename = real name of the file according to the file system

rank = increasing number calculated by the engine according to number of activations, number of other entries in the database, interval regularity, and dates of activations of each entry

checksum = might allow a document (non-application) to be identified and maintain its position on the list even if the user renames it

class = application signature or document mimetype

ignore = if "yes", no interfaces or applications will display this entry no matter what its rank is, although the rank will still be calculated in case the user wishes to un-ignore it sometime

owner = interfaces or applications that will display this entry, with "position" this entry will be locked into a specific position in that application's display, with "ignore" only that application will ignore this entry. Other applications will only display the entry if its rank is high enough to put it within the X number of entries they display.

date_last_act = last time this entry was opened/activated

date_first_act = first time the engine became aware of this entry being opened/activated

last_int = time interval between the last two activations

avg_daily_int = average time interval on a daily basis, this will help identify applications that get used on a daily basis but perhaps not at regular intervals, for instance someone might check their mail three times a day, morning noon and early afternoon before leaving work-- the interval would be irregular but the daily average would be pretty regular

int_reg = this will attempt to statistically identify applications that aren't used very often but are used at regular intervals 

daily_int_reg = same as above using avg_daily_int instead of last_int

Usage
It should be trivial to create a daemon that regularly takes the first X entries according to rank and makes symlinks in any folder (hint: a Recent Apps/Docs folder under /boot/home/config/be) like this:

ln -s /path/to/app/filename /path/to/destination/name

It's so simple it's a bit mind-boggling. Go BeOS!
